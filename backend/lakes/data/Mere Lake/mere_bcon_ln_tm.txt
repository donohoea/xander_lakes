  Description: 
    Abstract: All available bathymetry and related information for Mere Lake were collected and hard copy maps digitized where necessary. The data were validated against more recent data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 'SRTM' imagery and Indian Remote Sensing 'IRS'  imagery) and corrected where necessary. The published data set contains the lake bathymetry formatted as an Arc ascii grid. Bathymetric contours and the boundary polygon are available as shapefiles.
    Purpose: This dataset was created to preserve historical data for Mere Lake and to make the data available in digital form.

Data Quality Information: 
  Logical Consistency Report: Polylines represent bathymetry contours and do not cross or overlap. It is not known whether the lines have directionality, i.e. if they were digitized in a standard direction with respect to the lake shorelines or centres.
  Completeness Report: Unknown.
  Lineage: 
    Process Step: 
      Process Description: The bathymetry for Mere Lake was digitized. Depths in feet were converted to elevations in metres. The original boundary for the lake was retained. The 'Reshape' feature of ArcMap was used to adjust contours so as to fit inside the lake boundary. The 'Rotate' tool of ArcMap was used to adjust contours so as to fit inside the lake boundary. Most such edits were due to NAD shifts. The 'Edit' tool of ArcMap was used to drag contours inside the lake boundary. Most such edits were due to NAD shifts. The water level of the lake was set to 733.2m (from the Base Features data). This value was confirmed by data from the most recent data sources.
      Process Date: 2004
    Process Step: 
      Process Description: The lake bathymetry shapefile data tables supplied by the digitizing contractor contained a wide variety of differently named attributes. In spring 2008, Alberta Geological Survey standardized these data into two fields: CONTOUR and CALC_DEP_M (see Entity and Attribute section of this metadata). At that time data were also checked and corrected and/or calculated as required.
