  Description: 
    Abstract: All available bathymetry and related information for Lower Kananaskis Lake were collected and hard copy maps digitized where necessary. The data were validated against more recent data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 'SRTM' imagery and Indian Remote Sensing 'IRS'  imagery) and corrected where necessary. The published data set contains the lake bathymetry formatted as an Arc ascii grid. Bathymetric contours and the boundary polygon are available as shapefiles.
    Purpose: This dataset was created to preserve historical data for Lower Kananaskis Lake and to make the data available in digital form.

  Completeness Report: Unknown.
  Lineage: 
    Process Step: 
      Process Description: Lake outline data were prepared by GISmo solutions Ltd. Using provincial base hydrography GIS data as a start, each boundary was edited using lake-specific supplemental information which included hardcopy hydrographic survey maps, water level data, area/volume assessments, and IRS and TARIN imagery. The final outline and its reference elevation were validated against the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) data for Alberta.
