  Description: 
    Abstract: All available bathymetry and related information for Smoky Lake were collected and hard copy maps digitized where necessary. The data were validated against more recent data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 'SRTM' imagery and Indian Remote Sensing 'IRS'  imagery) and corrected where necessary. The published data set contains the lake bathymetry formatted as an Arc ascii grid. Bathymetric contours and the boundary polygon are available as shapefiles.
    Purpose: This dataset was created to preserve historical data for Smoky Lake and to make the data available in digital form.

Data Quality Information: 
  Logical Consistency Report: Grid models extend beyond the lake shoreline datasets by approximately 200 m. Grid cells with no data are assigned the value -9999.
  Completeness Report: Unknown.
  Lineage: 
    Process Step: 
      Process Description: Digital elevation models (DEMs) were created from the bathymetry contours generated for this lake (see cross-references for companion datasets to this file). Grids were created with a 50 m cell size in ArcInfo software then exported to ascii format for distribution.
